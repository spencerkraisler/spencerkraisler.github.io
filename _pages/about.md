Welcome to my website! I am Spencer Kraisler, a fourth year Ph.D. candidate in the Aeronautics and Astronautics department at University of Washington (UW) working with Prof. Mehran Mesbahi. I earned a B.S. in Mathematics at UW in 2021. I intend to defend my dissertation and graduate by January 2026. 

My research interests lie in learning, control, and geometry. The broad goal of my research is to use policy gradient methods to design optimal policies for control systems while also obtaining theoretical guarantees on convergence and optimizer performance. My target audience comprises RL experts who demand optimizer performance assurances in their control applications. While thereâ€™s ample potential for RL in control theory, we must ensure that all RL applications adhere to safety guarantees, as control theory primarily deals with both manned, expensive, and unstable systems where safety is absolutely paramount! My research intersects Riemannian geometry, machine learning, and control theory. For more detailed research projects and interests, please refer to the research tab and publication tab.
